# ImageResizer
Bulk resizes images using Sharp, image-size, and inquirer.

## Installation and Usage

For initial installation, within the repository directory run:
```
npm install
```
For each use run:
```
npm start
```
Then direct the resizer to the directory containing the files you'd like to check.


It avoids full width banner images, and avoids any image that isn't a jpg or png.


Resized images are placed in the output directory with the same filenames, if they're all images you want to resize simply drag and drop to the original directory and replace the originals.
